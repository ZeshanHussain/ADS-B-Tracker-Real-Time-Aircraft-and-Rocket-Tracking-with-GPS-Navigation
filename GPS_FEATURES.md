## SDR GPS Setup (Offline Operation)

### Why SDR GPS?

‚úÖ Works **without internet or cellular**  
‚úÖ **Independent** GPS reception  
‚úÖ **Tactical operations** in remote areas  
‚úÖ **Privacy** - not tracked by providers  
‚úÖ **Cost-effective** - $45-75 total

### Quick Setup:

**Hardware Needed:**
- RTL-SDR USB dongle (~$30)
- Active GPS antenna (~$20)
- Laptop/computer with USB port

**Software Install:**
```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S rtl-sdr gpsd gpsd-clients

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install rtl-sdr gpsd gpsd-clients
```

**Run GPS Reception:**
```bash
rtl_fm -f 1575.42M -s 2048000 -g 40 | gpsd -N -n /dev/stdin
```

**Test:**
```bash
cgps -s
```

**In Application:**
- Select "‚óâ SDR RECEIVER" as GPS source
- Application reads from gpsd automatically

**Full Details:** See `SDR_GPS_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide

## Physics & Calculations

All the same physics from aerial tracking applies to GPS navigation:

### Distance Calculations:
- **Haversine formula** for great-circle distance
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Accurate for any distance

### Bearing Calculations:
- True bearing from current position to destination
- Updates in real-time as you move
- Compensates for Earth's spherical geometry

### Speed & Velocity:
- GPS-derived speed (Doppler shift)
- Real-time updates
- Converted to km/h or mph

### ETA Calculation:
```
ETA = Distance / Current_Speed
```
Updates dynamically as speed changes

### Position Accuracy:
- **HDOP < 2.0** = Excellent (5-10m accuracy)
- **HDOP 2-5** = Good (10-20m accuracy)
- **HDOP > 5** = Poor (20+ m accuracy)

## Simulation Mode

For testing without GPS hardware:

**Simulated Driving:**
- Automatically drives toward destination at 50 km/h
- Updates position every second
- Realistic heading changes
- Reaches destination automatically

**Perfect for:**
- Testing the interface
- Demonstrating features
- Learning the system
- No hardware needed

## Integration with Aircraft Tracking

GPS navigation is **fully integrated** with aircraft tracking:

1. **Shared location** - Your GPS position updates aircraft tracking
2. **Proximity alerts** - Aircraft alerts based on your GPS position
3. **Real-time sync** - Move on GPS tab, aircraft map updates
4. **Seamless switching** - Tab between surveillance and navigation
