## Physics Experiments

### Experiment 1: Distance Verification

**Goal:** Verify Haversine formula accuracy

**Method:**
1. Set location to **New York** (40.7128, -74.0060)
2. Note distance to aircraft over **Los Angeles** (should be ~4,000 km)
3. Calculate manually: d = 2R √ó arcsin(‚àö...)
4. Compare with displayed value

### Experiment 2: Bearing Accuracy

**Goal:** Understand bearing angles

**Method:**
1. Place yourself at origin (0¬∞, 0¬∞)
2. Aircraft due North ‚Üí bearing = 0¬∞
3. Aircraft due East ‚Üí bearing = 90¬∞
4. Aircraft due South ‚Üí bearing = 180¬∞
5. Aircraft due West ‚Üí bearing = 270¬∞

### Experiment 3: Velocity Analysis

**Goal:** Compare aircraft speeds

**Setup:**
- Location: Major airport
- Data: OpenSky Network (Real)

**Observe:**
- **Cruise**: 200-250 m/s (450-560 mph)
- **Approach**: 70-100 m/s (155-225 mph)
- **Ground**: 0-20 m/s (taxiing)

**Physics:**
- v = 250 m/s ‚âà Mach 0.73 (subsonic)
- Supersonic: v > 343 m/s

### Experiment 4: 3D Distance

**Goal:** Understand altitude's effect on distance

**Method:**
1. Find aircraft directly overhead
2. Horizontal distance ‚âà 0 km
3. Altitude = 10 km
4. Total 3D distance = ‚àö(0¬≤ + 10¬≤) = 10 km

**Try:**
- Aircraft 10 km away horizontally, 10 km altitude
- 3D distance = ‚àö(10¬≤ + 10¬≤) = 14.14 km

### Experiment 5: Closure Rate

**Goal:** Calculate relative velocity

**Method:**
1. Note aircraft distance at time t‚ÇÅ
2. Note aircraft distance at time t‚ÇÇ (5 seconds later)
3. Closure rate = (d‚ÇÅ - d‚ÇÇ) / Œît

**Example:**
- t‚ÇÅ: 50 km away
- t‚ÇÇ: 48.75 km away (5 sec later)
- Rate = (50 - 48.75) / 5 = 0.25 km/s = 250 m/s

## Advanced Challenges

### Challenge 1: Intercept Calculation

**Problem:** If you launch to intercept an aircraft 100 km away traveling at 250 m/s, how fast must you go to intercept in 2 minutes?

**Given:**
- Distance: 100 km = 100,000 m
- Time: 2 min = 120 s
- Target velocity: 250 m/s

**Solution:**
- Required velocity: v = d/t = 100,000/120 ‚âà 833 m/s (Mach 2.4!)

### Challenge 2: Launch Window

**Problem:** A rocket launch is in 4 hours and 200 km away. If you drive at 100 km/h, will you make it?

**Solution:**
- Time needed: 200 km √∑ 100 km/h = 2 hours
- Time available: 4 hours
- ‚úÖ Yes! With 2 hours to spare

### Challenge 3: Horizon Distance

**Problem:** At what distance does an aircraft at 10 km altitude disappear below your horizon?

**Formula:** d = ‚àö(2Rh) where R = 6,371 km, h = 10 km

**Solution:**
- d = ‚àö(2 √ó 6371 √ó 10) = ‚àö127,420 ‚âà 357 km

**Verify:** Watch aircraft at 350+ km in the app!
