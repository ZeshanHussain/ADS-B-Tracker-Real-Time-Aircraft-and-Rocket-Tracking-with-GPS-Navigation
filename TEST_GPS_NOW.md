# ‚úÖ Ready to Test!

The GeoClue2 demo agent is now running in the background. This authorizes GPS access for all applications.

## Run Your Application Now

```bash
./build/AircraftRocketTracker
```

## What to Expect

### ‚úÖ Success - You should see:
```
System GPS available: "geoclue2"
Starting system GPS...
System GPS started
```

‚úÖ **No more permission errors!**

### ‚è±Ô∏è Normal Behavior - You might see:
```
GPS timeout - no position update in 30 seconds
System GPS Error: "GPS signal lost - waiting for position fix"
```

This is **NORMAL** because:
- Most computers don't have GPS hardware
- GPS requires outdoor line-of-sight to satellites
- GeoClue will fall back to WiFi/IP-based location (if available)

### üéØ Solution: Use Simulated GPS

In your application:
1. Switch to **"Simulated GPS"** mode (in the GPS source dropdown)
2. This gives you a working GPS feed for testing
3. Perfect for development!

## Next Time You Run

**Option 1 - Using the launch script (easiest):**
```bash
./run_with_gps.sh
```

**Option 2 - Manual (if agent isn't running):**
```bash
# Terminal 1:
/usr/lib/geoclue-2.0/demos/agent

# Terminal 2:
./build/AircraftRocketTracker
```

## Verify Demo Agent is Running

```bash
ps aux | grep "demos/agent" | grep -v grep
```

Should show the agent process.

## Current Status

‚úÖ Configuration installed: `/etc/geoclue/conf.d/10-rocket-tracker.conf`  
‚úÖ Application recompiled with proper identification  
‚úÖ Demo agent running in background  
‚úÖ GeoClue2 service active  

**You're all set! Go ahead and run the application.** üöÄ
