# GPS Setup Guide

## Quick Start - RECOMMENDED ‚úÖ

**Use Simulated GPS mode - no configuration needed!**

1. Launch the app: `./build/AircraftRocketTracker`
2. Select "**Simulated GPS**" from the GPS source dropdown  
3. Done! You have a working GPS feed.

This is perfect for development, testing, and demo purposes.

## System GPS (Linux GeoClue2) - Complex Setup ‚ö†Ô∏è

System GPS on Linux requires GeoClue2 authorization, which is complex to configure.

### Current Issue

GeoClue2 has a strict permission system that causes:
```
qt.positioning.geoclue2: Unable to obtain the client: "org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply"
GPS Error: "GPS Access Denied - Check permissions"
```

### Why This Happens

- GeoClue2 requires an authorization agent
- Qt's GeoClue2 plugin has DBus timeout issues
- Desktop apps need explicit configuration

### Fix Options

**Option 1: Modify System Config (requires sudo)**
```bash
sudo ./apply_fix.sh
```

This adds your app to `/etc/geoclue/geoclue.conf` with system-level permissions.

**Option 2: Use Simulated GPS (recommended)**
```bash
./build/AircraftRocketTracker
# Then select "Simulated GPS" in the UI
```

Much simpler and works great for testing!

**Option 3: Demo Agent (temporary)**
```bash
./run_with_gps.sh
```

Uses GeoClue demo agent while the app runs.

## GPS Modes Comparison

### üéØ Simulated GPS (BEST for development)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ No permissions needed
- ‚úÖ No hardware required  
- ‚úÖ Consistent test data
- ‚úÖ Perfect for demos

### üì° System GPS (via GeoClue2)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex Linux setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires configuration
- ‚ùå Usually no real GPS hardware anyway
- ‚ùå Doesn't work indoors
- ‚ùì Only useful if you have GPS hardware

### üìª SDR GPS
- For software-defined radio GPS receivers
- Specialized hardware required

## Recommendation

**For 99% of use cases: Use Simulated GPS mode!**

It's simpler, more reliable, and better for development. System GPS is only needed if you have actual GPS hardware and need real-world positioning.
